Section A: MCQ Answers

1. A) Change in position of an object with time
2. B) Total length of the path covered by an object
3. B) Shortest distance between initial and final position
4. A) A car moving with constant speed on a straight road
5. B) Unequal distances in equal time intervals

Section B: Short Answers

1. Distance is the total length of the path travelled by an object, while displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final position.

2. Uniform motion means covering equal distances in equal intervals of time.

3. A reference point is important because position or motion is described with respect to a fixed point.

Section C: Long Answers

1. Uniform motion occurs when an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time. Non-uniform motion occurs when an object covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time.

2. Graphical representation helps us understand motion visually using time on one axis and distance/displacement on the other axis.`;

You are an expert CBSE school teacher and question paper setter.

Generate a high-quality examination paper ONLY from the chapter content provided below.

SUBJECT:
${subject}

CHAPTER:
${selectedChapter}

PAPER SET:
${selectedSet}

PAPER TYPE:
${paperType}

IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Use ONLY concepts present in the chapter content.
FOR MATHEMATICS:
ABSOLUTE MATHEMATICS RULE:

If chapter contains an Exercise section,
generate ALL questions only from:

- Exercise questions
- Solved examples
- Practice questions

Ignore every other chapter section completely.

Do not generate questions from explanatory text,
activities, illustrations, figures, room layouts,
bathroom layouts, stories, introductions or examples
outside the exercise section.

Generate questions primarily from:
- solved examples
- exercise questions
- practice questions
- worked numerical problems
If the chapter contains Exercise Sets, Practice Problems,
Worked Examples or End-of-Chapter Exercises:

Generate 100% questions ONLY from:

- Exercise Questions
- Solved Examples
- Worked Examples
- Practice Questions

Never generate questions from chapter introduction,
history sections, stories, activities or explorations.

Do not invent new story-based questions.

Prefer rewording existing exercise questions over creating entirely new questions.

Exercise questions have highest priority.
Worked examples have second priority.
Theory text has lowest priority.

Do NOT generate questions from:
- historical notes
- introduction sections
- stories
- facts
- mathematicians
- history boxes
- "Did you know" content
- chapter background information




2. Do NOT generate questions from:
   - chapter title
   - page numbers
   - metadata
   - author names
   - acknowledgements
   - index
3. Do NOT invent topics not present in the chapter.
4. Generate different questions for different paper sets.
5. Include competency-based questions.
6. Include application-based questions.
7. Include higher-order thinking questions wherever possible.
8. Avoid repeating the same question in different forms.
9. Questions should resemble real school examination papers.
10. Use previous-year exam style wherever possible.
11. Cover all important topics from the chapter.
12. Do not refer to figures, diagrams, maps or tables unless actual figure data exists.

13. Questions must be directly based on chapter concepts.
14. Avoid irrelevant or metadata-based questions.
15. Do not ask questions that require a figure, diagram, map, image,
room layout, bathroom layout, graph or visual reference unless the
actual figure data is present in the chapter text.
16. If a question refers to Fig., Diagram, Graph, Image, Layout or Map,
convert it into a text-based mathematical problem using the available
coordinates, values or numerical information.
17. If a question depends on a figure, diagram, graph, map, room layout
or image that is not fully available in text form, do not use that question.

Instead generate a similar question using only the coordinates,
values or numerical information explicitly present in the chapter text.

Never ask:
- What are the coordinates of point X in Fig. ...
- What is the width of the door in Fig. ...
- What is shown in the diagram ...

unless all required coordinates and values are explicitly present in text.

If PAPER TYPE is Exhaustive:

Generate:

10 MCQs
10 Short Answer Questions
5 Long Answer Questions
3 HOTS Questions
2 Case Study Questions

Cover every topic and subtopic from the chapter.

Every important concept must appear at least once.

- competency based questions
- application based questions
- analytical questions
- previous year style questions

SPECIAL RULE FOR MATHEMATICS:

If SUBJECT is Mathematics:

Generate ONLY mathematics examination questions.
CRITICAL:

Generate questions only from concepts explicitly found
inside the provided chapter text.

Do not use your own mathematics knowledge to extend
the chapter beyond the provided content.

Do not generate any formula, theorem, concept,
question type or coordinate geometry operation
that is not explicitly present in the chapter content.

Forbidden unless explicitly present in chapter:

- Distance Formula
- Midpoint Formula
- Section Formula
- Equation of Line
- Slope Formula
- Area of Triangle using Coordinates

If these topics are not present in the chapter text,
do not generate questions from them.



CRITICAL:

Before generating the paper, first identify:

1. Worked Examples
2. Solved Examples
3. Exercise Questions
4. Practice Problems
5. End-of-Chapter Questions

Generate the paper primarily from these sections.

If exercise questions are available, do not generate questions from:
- chapter introduction
- historical content
- background reading
- explanatory stories

Exercise questions have highest priority.

Worked examples have second priority.

Theory text has lowest priority.

For Mathematics:
If exercise questions are available, generate questions ONLY from exercise questions and solved examples.

Do not generate questions from:
- figures
- room layouts
- bathroom layouts
- illustrations
- visual activities
- graphical activities

unless complete numerical data is explicitly available in text.


MATHEMATICS CHAPTER ACCURACY RULE:

The difficulty and type of questions must match the actual chapter content.

If the chapter mainly teaches concepts, coordinates, quadrants, axes, origin, or identification of points, generate conceptual and identification-based questions.

Do not force numerical calculations if the chapter does not explicitly teach numerical methods.

The generated paper should resemble the actual NCERT exercise questions of that chapter.

OUTPUT RULES:

Do not skip this section.
FINAL REJECTION RULE:

Reject any question containing:

- Distance Formula
- Midpoint Formula
- Section Formula
- Slope
- Equation of Line
- Circle
- Collinearity
- Centroid

unless these exact topics appear inside the extracted exercise section.

If any of these topics are absent,
do not generate questions using them.
STRICT MATHEMATICS FILTER

Generate questions ONLY from topics explicitly present in the extracted text.

Never introduce:

- Distance Formula
- Midpoint Formula
- Section Formula
- Slope
- Equation of Line
- Circle
- Coordinate Proofs

unless these exact topics appear in the extracted text.

If not present, do not generate any question related to them.

Every question must contain at least one keyword that appears in the extracted chapter text.

Do not invent concepts, formulas, theorems, or mathematical terms that are not present in the extracted text.

If a concept is not explicitly mentioned in the chapter text, pretend that concept does not exist.
ULTIMATE VALIDATION RULE:

Before generating each question:

Verify that the exact concept exists in CHAPTER CONTENT.

If the concept is not explicitly present in CHAPTER CONTENT,
the question is forbidden.

Examples of forbidden concepts unless explicitly present:

- Distance between two points
- Distance Formula
- Midpoint Formula
- Section Formula
- Slope
- Equation of Line
- Circle
- Area using Coordinates
- Coordinate Proofs

If a forbidden concept appears in a question,
discard that question and generate a replacement.
